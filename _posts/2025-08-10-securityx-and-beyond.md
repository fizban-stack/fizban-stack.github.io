After my last post, I thought to myself why not go ahead and take the SecurityX exam. I had a retest in case I failed, but I ended up not needing it. I wanted to attempt the exam and get some idea of what the questions looked like. I think that the momentum that is built by taking the lower level exams only makes the higher level exam easier.

I wasn't sure what to expect from the rebranded CASP+ exam, but it did not fail to disappoint. Each question provided a scenario that guided you towards the answer. There were questions that had several correct answer, but there was only one that fit the given scenario. This exam also included the use of a virtual machine to test the hands-on ability of the test taker.

Personally, I thought that the Cysa+ and the Pentest+ exams were harder, but I think that is because of the specialized nature of them. The SecurityX covers a broad range of topics and therefore has a large knowledge base to pull questions from.

When I decided that I wanted to switch careers, I enrolled in college to get a degree and made a plan to get the Security+. I thought that the degree and Security+ would be a good start on getting an entry-level cyber security job. After I started applying I realized that cyber security isn't really entry-level and that there is fierce competition for the available jobs. Then I planned on getting maybe one more certification before I graduated. Now I am graduating next Spring and am holding all of the CompTIA cyber security certifications.

Honestly, I am not sure where to go from here. I also want to get the OSCP, but I am unable to afford it right now. I have been using the next level exam to renew the lower level certifications, but now that I have the highest cyber security exam I am going to have to learn how to submit CEUs. I have been attending local and virtual conferences, so I am sure I will have no problem getting the CEUs. I will just need to get into the habit of submitting them.
