Meshtastic is an open-source, off-grid communication platform that uses inexpensive LoRa (Long Range) radio modules to create decentralized mesh networks. Unlike traditional radios that require direct line-of-sight or cellular networks that depend on infrastructure, Meshtastic devices automatically relay messages through other nodes in the network, extending range significantly. Each radio can communicate several miles in open terrain, but by hopping through multiple devices, messages can travel much further. The system works completely offline with no monthly fees, making it ideal for hiking, camping, emergency preparedness, or any situation where cellular coverage is unreliable or unavailable.

The project supports various hardware platforms, primarily ESP32-based devices, which can be purchased for around $30-50. Users can communicate via smartphone apps (iOS/Android) over Bluetooth, or use the radios standalone with small OLED screens. Beyond simple text messaging, Meshtastic supports GPS position sharing, creating a live map of all nodes in your mesh network. The community has built additional features like remote sensor monitoring, weather station integration, and even MQTT gateways to bridge multiple mesh networks over the internet. It's become popular with hikers, preppers, amateur radio enthusiasts, and anyone interested in resilient, community-owned communications infrastructure.

I live in an area that does not have great cell phone coverage everywhere so I bought a pair of these devices for when my family and I a hiking through the woods and loose service. After purchasing this pair of devices and using them for a few times, I regretted not spending the extra money and getting a pair with a larger screen and a keyboard. These are bad to use once you get them connected to your cell phone, but sometimes the configuration would not stick and I found myself unable to connect them without resetting the device.
