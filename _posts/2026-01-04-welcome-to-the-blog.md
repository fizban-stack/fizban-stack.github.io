Welcome to my technical blog! This is where I'll be sharing my experiences, insights, and tutorials related to cybersecurity, home labs, and technology.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find posts covering various topics including:

- **Cybersecurity** - Penetration testing, vulnerability research, and security best practices
- **Home Lab** - Self-hosted applications, infrastructure projects, and configurations
- **Technology** - Tools, frameworks, and interesting technical discoveries

## Writing Posts

All blog posts are written in Markdown and automatically organized by category. Each post is its own file in the `_posts` directory, making it easy to manage and version control.
