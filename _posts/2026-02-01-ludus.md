I have been using Proxmox for a few years now and my solution for deploying VMs for the first year was always to deploy VMs one at a time from scratch. Then I started using the following process:

1. Download ISO
2. Deploy VM and install operating system
3. Backup VM after base programs such as Docker are installed
4. Restore from backup as a different VM if necessary

I had never used templates in Proxmox until I started using Ludus. It is amazing how templates turn your VMs from objects that you want to maintain into disposable objects. I know that I could have done the same thing with my backups, but since I use Proxmox Backup Server for backups, it is a lot faster to store a template locally. I had started to learn Ansible, but I never got too far because I would just build my cyber lab the old fashioned way and keep those VMs backed up as well.

## What is Ludus?

Ludus is an open-source, API-driven infrastructure management platform created by Bad Sector Labs. It is built on top of Proxmox and uses Packer and Ansible to deploy complex testing ranges from a single YAML configuration file. The platform is licensed under AGPLv3 and targets security professionals, QA teams, developers, and red/blue team operators seeking faster infrastructure provisioning.

The magic of Ludus is that it takes what would normally be hours or days of manual configuration and reduces it to a single command. Need an Active Directory environment with multiple domain controllers, workstations, and specific vulnerabilities? Define it in YAML and deploy.

## Key Features and Components

### Automated Deployment

Ludus enables users to deploy and configure complex networks with a single command through YAML-based configuration. No more clicking through wizards or manually configuring each VM.

### Template System

Templates are built from scratch using ISO files rather than relying on pre-customized images. All builtin templates deploy the bare minimum to allow Ansible to work (python3/powershell and SSH/WinRM) and a user to connect via RDP, SSH, or KasmVNC. This approach supports true infrastructure-as-code practices.

**Builtin Templates:**
- Debian 11 and 12
- Kali Linux
- Windows 11 (22H2, x64 Enterprise)
- Windows Server 2022 (x64)

**Additional Community Templates:**
- Linux: Debian 10, Rocky 9, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04
- Windows: Windows 10 (21H1), Windows 11 (23H2), Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019
- Specialized: Commando VM, FLARE VM, REMnux

### Network and Connectivity

- Up to 255 VLANs with customizable firewall rules
- Internal DNS with domain rewrite capabilities
- Direct access via SSH, RDP, VNC, or KasmVNC
- Built-in WireGuard server for secure remote connectivity
- VM isolation from internet connectivity when needed

### Security and OPSEC Features

- Snapshot management before/after isolation
- Selective domain/IP allowlisting for testing scenarios
- Telemetry containment capabilities
- Multiple isolated ranges per server

## My Experience

Using Ludus makes it almost too easy to set up an environment. I had just finished getting Game of Active Directory working on my Proxmox node the hard way. I set it up on my desktop using VMware and then exported it out and imported all the VMs into Proxmox. I got them setup on their private network. I setup Guacamole to remote into my Kali machine. Then I installed Tailscale on Kali so that I could remotely access my lab from anywhere.

This is an entirely different story, but once you get a VPN setup for your lab and get used to having the freedom to access it remotely, it is hard to go back. If I have a few minutes at the doctor's office, I can spend that "playing" in my lab. I am not yet proficient in exploitation, or recon really. Recon takes me the longest. I have a hard time moving on to something else once I get an idea in my head.

With Ludus, that entire GOAD setup process becomes a configuration file and a few commands. The WireGuard integration means remote access is built-in from the start.

## Available Labs and Environments

Ludus has an impressive collection of pre-built environment guides that you can deploy. Here are the labs currently available:

### Active Directory Labs

**[Game of Active Directory (GOAD)](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/goad)** - The flagship AD lab created by @M4yFly. A comprehensive vulnerable Active Directory environment for practicing attacks like Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, delegation attacks, and more. There are also variants:
- **[GOAD - NHA](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/goad-nha)** - Network variant of GOAD
- **[GOAD - SCCM](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/goad-sccm)** - Includes System Center Configuration Manager for practicing SCCM-specific attacks

**[Basic Active Directory Network](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/basic-ad-network)** - A simpler AD setup for those just getting started with Active Directory penetration testing.

**[ADCS](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/adcs)** - Active Directory Certificate Services lab for practicing certificate-based attacks, a critical skill given the prevalence of ADCS misconfigurations in enterprise environments.

**[SANS Workshop: Active Directory](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/sans-workshop-active-directory-privilege-escalation-with-empire)** - Lab environment based on SANS training materials.

### CTF and Workshop Labs

**[BarbHack CTF 2024 (Gotham City - Active Directory Lab)](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/barbhack-ctf-2024)** - A CTF-style Active Directory environment with a Batman theme.

**[Netexec Workshop (leHACK 2024)](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/netexec-workshop-lehack-2024)** - Workshop environment for learning NetExec, the network execution tool used for lateral movement and credential testing.

**[Netexec Workshop (leHACK 2025)](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/netexec-workshop-lehack-2025)** - Updated version of the NetExec workshop.

### Security Research Labs

**[Malware Lab (xz backdoor)](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/malware-lab-xz-backdoor)** - A lab environment for studying the infamous xz backdoor (CVE-2024-3094), allowing safe analysis of this supply chain attack.

**[Elastic Security](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/elastic)** - Lab environment with Elastic SIEM for practicing detection engineering and blue team operations.

**[Pivot Lab](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/pivot-lab)** - Environment designed for practicing network pivoting techniques, essential for moving through segmented networks during engagements.

### Custom Ranges

Beyond pre-built environments, Ludus excels at letting you define custom ranges. Need a specific configuration for a client engagement or CTF preparation? Define your VMs, networks, and configurations in YAML and deploy.

## Complete Setup Instructions for Proxmox

### System Requirements

- x86_64 CPU with Passmark score exceeding 6,000
- Debian 12/13 or Proxmox 8/9 host
- Minimum 32GB RAM per user/range
- At least 200GB storage initially, plus 50GB per deployment
- Internet connectivity (wired, not WiFi)
- Root shell access

### Prerequisites

You need a Proxmox 8 or 9 server. No reboot is required for existing installations.

**Important Warning:** Using an existing Proxmox installation may cause issues with existing customizations. The documentation strongly recommends a fresh Bare Metal Debian 12/13 installation if starting from scratch.

### Installation Steps

There is a little bit of setup at the beginning, but nothing too complex. Then, there is a single install script that interactively installs Ludus. It asks you about storage and architecture.

**Option 1: All-in-one command**

```bash
curl -s https://ludus.cloud/install | bash
```

**Option 2: Verify the script first (recommended)**

```bash
curl https://ludus.cloud/install > install.sh
cat install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### What the Installer Does

The installer will automatically:
- Extract files to `/opt/ludus`
- Install packages: ansible, packer, dnsmasq, sshpass, curl, jq, iptables-persistent, gpg-agent, dbus, dbus-user-session, vim
- Install Python packages: proxmoxer, requests, netaddr, pywinrm, dnspython, jmespath
- Create Proxmox groups, pools, networking interfaces, and system services

### Post-Installation: Create a User

After installation, follow the Quick Start guide to create a user. You will receive an API key and WireGuard configuration.

### Getting Started as a User

1. Obtain API key and WireGuard configuration from the administrator (or yourself if self-hosting)
2. Download or compile the Ludus client
3. Import and connect the WireGuard VPN
4. Execute `ludus apikey` with your credentials
5. Use the CLI for range management

### Post-Installation Troubleshooting

**Configuration adjustments:** Edit `/opt/ludus/config.yml` and restart services:

```bash
systemctl restart ludus-admin
systemctl restart ludus
```

**Storage permissions:** If you need to grant access to new datastores:

```bash
pveum acl modify /storage/<name> -group ludus_users -role DatastoreUser
pveum acl modify /storage/<name> -group ludus_admins -role PVEDatastoreAdmin
```

**Network issues:** If VMs lack IP addresses or internet connectivity, consult the networking troubleshooting guide in the official documentation.

## Why Ludus Changed My Workflow

The combination of Proxmox templates, Ansible automation, and WireGuard connectivity creates an environment where spinning up a complex cyber lab becomes trivial. Instead of spending a weekend configuring Active Directory, installing vulnerable services, and setting up networking, I can define what I want and let Ludus handle the implementation.

For anyone running a homelab focused on security research, CTF practice, or professional development, Ludus is worth exploring. The learning curve is minimal compared to the time saved, and the infrastructure-as-code approach means your lab configurations become reproducible and shareable.
