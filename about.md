My name is James Wells. I am currently working at RBR Alliance in my first security job. The position, Information Technology Security Professional, was created after an incident and I am the first person to fill it. My responsibilities include managing two Microsoft 365 tenants and three Active Directory domains. My old position included maintaining, troubleshooting, and fixing all manner of devices, from phones to servers. My new position gives me responsibility for the security of the organization. My first projects are to create a centralized syslog server, upgrade older Cisco ASA firewalls to newer Cisco Meraki firewalls, and create a more comprehensive asset documentation, including create network maps and security documentation.

I am the father of three children. In the free time I have outside of work and family, I have become an home lab enthusiast or as my children refer to me "a tinkerer". I have brought down our network enough times that they always look at me as the culprit when there is an internet outage. A few years ago, I began my homelab with an outdated HP computer and TrueNAS scale. Since then I have spent more time and money than I like to admit on it. I found that eBay is a great place to buy testing equipment, but it is essential to buy at least hard drives new. When I started building my home lab, I had no Linux experience at all, but now I more comfortable in Linux terminal than I am in the Windows GUI. Sometimes, I am working on a Windows computer and think I would already have this done by now if I was working in Linux terminal. Because of this I have been spending more time learning PowerShell, so that I am as proficient in Windows CLI as I am in Linux. I never thought that I would find it easier to create and modify a file on a terminal than in a GUI.

I also enjoy going on walks, basketball, and skateboarding, though I have found out that skateboarding hurts a lot worse than I remember. I have gotten past that recently though and am really enjoying being back on a board again. My youngest daughter skateboarding with me makes it so much better. I am not back to doing all of my old tricks yet, but I did land my first kickflip in almost two decades.

## My past

I was born in Evansville, Indiana in 1988. I am the middle child with two brothers and two sisters. I became interested in technology at an early age. I remember using dial-up internet just to learn as much as I could. There wasn't much back then though. I built my first computer from spare parts at the age of 11 and even though it was a time consuming process plagued with setbacks, I was hooked. I then began learning how to optimize older hardware so that I could afford to play games. My father left when I was in the third grade and although we still visited him every other weekend, he was not really my father anymore. He never came to any events or really wanted to spend anytime with us unless it was watching movies. I was basically raised by my mother and older sister. I was always in the top three students of any class that I was in. Even in high school when I thought I was too cool for school, all of the teachers knew that I had the potential to succeed in anything I wanted to. The problem for a while though was that I didn't want to succeed. I just wanted to not be anxious when being in public places. This led me to take a darker path for several years. It wasn't until I was a father that I realized, I had been working to stay in the same place for a long time. One of my biggest regrets is not joining the Navy when I graduated from high school. All I had to do was pass the physical and drug test
