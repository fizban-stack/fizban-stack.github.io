My name is James Wells. I am currently working at RBR Alliance in my first security job. The position, Information Technology Security Professional, was created after an incident and I am the first person to fill it. My responsibilities include managing two Microsoft 365 tenants and three Active Directory domains. My old position included maintaining, troubleshooting, and fixing all manner of devices, from phones to servers. My new position gives me resposibility for the security of the organization. My first projects are to create a centralized syslog server, upgrade older Cisco ASA firewalls to newer Cisco Meraki firewalls, and create a more comprehensive asset documentation, including create network maps and security documentation.

I am the father of three children. In the free time I have outside of work and family, I have become an home lab enthusiast or as my children refer to me "a tinkerer". I have brought down our network enough times that they always look at me as the culprit when there is an internet outage. A few years ago, I began my homelab with an outdated HP computer and TrueNAS scale. Since then I have spent more time and money than I like to admit on it. I found that eBay is a great place to buy testing equipment, but it is essential to buy at least hard drives new. When I started building my home lab, I had no Linux experience at all, but now I more comfortable in Linux terminal than I am in the Windows GUI. Sometimes, I am working on a Windows computer and think I would already have this done by now if I was working in Linux terminal. Because of this I have been spending more time learning PowerShell, so that I am as proficient in Windows CLI as I am in Linux. I never thought that I would find it easier to create and modify a file on a terminal than in a GUI.

I also enjoy going on walks, basketball, and skateboarding, though I have found out that skateboarding hurts a lot worse than I remember.
