I think that taking the test with the Network+ information still fresh helped me on some of the Security+ questions.\n\nThen time went on and I got a job in IT. I was not as determined to get certifications at this point because I was going to school and getting some hands on experience at work. Then I entered into my Senior year at college and realized that my discount was going to go away soon. I bought the voucher for the Pentest+ and scheduled the exam for the day before my family was going on vacation to Gatlinburg, TN. I knew if I passed it, I could ride that good feeling right into my vacation, but if I failed it, I might have spent my vacation thinking about what questions I got wrong. I ended up passing it though.\n\nAfter passing the Pentest+, I thought that I should go ahead and purchase the vouchers for the two other exams that I wanted to pass before I graduated. I purchased the vouchers for the Cysa+ and the newly branded SecurityX (formerly CASP+). I ended up buying both vouchers with a retake, so I thought screw it. I will go ahead and take the Cysa+ exam the weekend after I got back from vacation, two weeks after I passed the Pentest+. I also passed that exam and I think that building on the exams one after the other like that helped me to build my knowledge and to better retain it.\n\nI passed the Cysa+ two weeks ago and now I scheduled the exam for the SecurityX for a little over a week away. I am not overly confident that I will pass it, but I have been studying for it since before I started my cyber security journey and am currently making sure that I have all of the domains covered. If I don't pass it, I will probably give myself about a month to study more and then take the exam again.\n\nI spent a long time telling myself that I could not afford certifications, while also buying video games and systems. Then I realized that buying the certifications was not wasting money on a piece of paper, but investing in my future. I got a late start on my cyber security journey, so now I am doing everything I can to make up for it.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-08-05T19:33:20.000Z","updated_at":"2025-08-05T19:50:26.000Z","published_at":"2025-08-05T19:50:26.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6898d7d773824700012d5787","uuid":"e81b1c86-f348-424e-82b8-2124faa66b2f","title":"SecurityX and beyond","slug":"securityx-and-beyond","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"After my last post, I thought to myself why not go ahead and take the SecurityX exam.

In this post, I will dive into the network layout, but first I want to discuss the various ways to keep track of network information. Once you get your network setup, it will be hard to keep track of what service is at which IP address. A reverse proxy helps to solve some of these issues, but then if the proxy goes down you are stuck trying to find the IP address again.\n\nThe first option that I used was just a pen and a piece of paper, it was actually a sticky note. I began to write the network address on the top and then the host addresses by the service name. This worked okay at first, but if I had any changes my sticky note would be covered in scribbles or I would have to start a new note and copy everything over to it.

I was the first cyber security defensive tool that I deployed and learned to use. I had an Intel NUC with an 8-core CPU and 64 GB of RAM that I first deployed it on. It only had one built-in NIC so I bought a ethernet USB adapter and used that for the management interface. After running it for a few months, I decided to repurpose the NUC and use it as a Proxmox node. I started using Wazuh for my EDR and SIEM and used intrusion detection on my Opnsense firewall.\n\nI had no intentions of redeploying Security Onion, but then my boss said something that bothered me. I work for a non-profit that performs IT and administration services for several other non-profits in the area. We are a three-person IT team that supports around 1000 employees across Indiana.\n\nWhen I was hired we discussed all the ways that I could help the company from a security perspective. He told me that they had been trying to get Security Onion going for a while but he had not been successful even installing it. I had already deployed it several different times in my home lab so I was pretty familiar with it. Within my first week, I had Security Onion installed and running. It was not easy because he wanted to use hardware that was almost a decade old and barely met the absolute minimum requirements. It did not stay running for longer than a month on that hardware so we shut it down.\n\nWe suffered a cyber incident earlier this year and my boss began thinking of all the things we could have done differently. At first, he was asking for ideas for improvement, but after a few weeks he decided that he wanted to offload most of the security administration. We discussed whether or not Security Onion would have helped to prevent the attack and we came to the conclusion that it would not because it is not inline and does not prevent attacks.\n\nWe were discussing purchasing a new firewall, but he was not sure about the security features included with them. I suggested PfSense because it is cheaper than many alternatives and I am quite comfortable with it. It can also be used as an inline intrusion prevention tool. A few days after that, he brought it up and made the comment that we could not even get Security Onion running so PfSense was probably a bit much for us. I know that I should not let it bother me and it is not that big of a deal, but I spent 80% of my time and money for the last 4 years working on my cyber security skill.\n\nThe purpose of this post originally was to document the installation and configuration of Security Onion, but it ended up being more of a rant post.

I used the following command to test it.\n\ncurl -X PUT http://192.168.1.63/api/6Z6yeXFzRcZSYwH2g7l2qVe9xRKqR6g4XiBdXRJu/lights/5/state -H \"Content-Type\":\"application/json\" -d '{\"on\":\"false\"}'\n\nAfter countless tries, I could not get this command to work in Windows. I tried using Command Prompt instead of PowerShell and I tried calling curl.exe since curl is an alias for Invoke-WebRequest in PowerShell. Then I converted the command to use the Invoke-WebRequest syntax. The following command successfully shut the light off.\n\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri \"http://192.168.1.63/api/6Z6yeXFzRcZSYwH2g7l2qVe9xRKqR6g4XiBdXRJu/lights/5/state\" -Method PUT -Body '{\"on\":false}' -ContentType \"application/json\"\n\nThis would only turn one light on or off at a time though. I thought about chaining two commands together to turn them both off at once, but after referring to the documentation, realized that I could send commands to groups. Group 0 refers to all of the Hue lights and using the following command I was able to query the Hue bridge and get a list of my groups.\n\ncurl http://192.168.1.63/api/6Z6yeXFzRcZSYwH2g7l2qVe9xRKqR6g4XiBdXRJu/groups | jq\n\nSince jq would not work in PowerShell, I switched back to the Command Prompt and got the following response.\n\n  \"82\": {\n    \"name\": \"Kids\",\n    \"lights\": [\n      \"5\",\n      \"6\"\n    ],\n    \"sensors\": [],\n    \"type\": \"Room\",\n    \"state\": {\n      \"all_on\": true,\n      \"any_on\": true\n    },\n    \"recycle\": false,\n    \"class\": \"Living room\",\n    \"action\": {\n      \"on\": true,\n      \"bri\": 254,\n      \"hue\": 8417,\n      \"sat\": 140,\n      \"effect\": \"none\",\n      \"xy\": [\n        0.1900,\n        0.0600\n      ],\n      \"ct\": 366,\n      \"alert\": \"select\",\n      \"colormode\": \"ct\"\n    }\n\nThen, I had the group name for the kids room and was ready to test it out on them. I used the following command to turn all of the lights off at once.\n\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri \"http://192.168.1.63/api/6Z6yeXFzRcZSYwH2g7l2qVe9xRKqR6g4XiBdXRJu/lights/5/state\" -Method PUT -Body '{\"on\":false}' -ContentType \"application/json\"\n\nIt worked perfectly. My girls started yelling at me and then I walked them through this entire process. They weren't really that interested, but I still think it is valuable knowledge for them to have, especially with the prevalence of smart devices.\n\nI had been thinking about how I could use an NFC tag to turn on and off my desk light. My plan up until this point was to configure it using Home Assistant. I might just use these API calls now if I can figure out how to make it toggle instead of calling on or off.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-10-12T02:20:30.000Z","updated_at":"2025-11-26T14:17:26.000Z","published_at":"2025-10-12T03:21:44.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"68efc9bb0e12d90001f5391d","uuid":"56db9f53-8789-4c68-b468-515530c59142","title":"You either evolve or die.","slug":"you-either-evolve-or-die","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"It was June 2022, when I realized that I had been living live on auto pilot.

I was not really prepared, but I thought I would give it a try anyways. This exam was the first cyber security certification test that I failed. Even though I wasn't overly confident going into the test, I still thought I could pass.\n\nAfter failing this exam, I doubled down on studying offensive techniques. I started doing modules in the Hack the Box Academy. These helped me to get an understanding of tools, but most of the modules walked you through an attack and the asked you to perform the exact same attack. If you were unsure of what to do, you could just scroll up and there the answer was. Not all of the modules were like this though. There were a few that altered the box enough that it was a completely different experience.\n\nI also setup a Kali VM and a few vulnerable machines, including Metasploitable 2 and 3, in Proxmox. I liked using Proxmox for my cyber lab because I could take snapshots of the machines and easily revert back to the beginning state. The snapshots were also stored on a separate machine running Proxmox Backup Server, so even when my hardware eventually failed, it only took me around 15 minutes to get completely up and running again.\n\nOne day I got an email from my councilor at Champlain College. She said that I would have enough credits to graduate the following Spring or Summer depending on whether or not I took a couple extra classes one semester. This was kind of a surprise to me. I knew that I was doing good and that certifications had put me a little bit ahead, but I was getting reading to graduate after just three years. This was both a good and bad thing. I was using my student discount to make my certifications more affordable since I was paying for them out of my own pocket.\n\nRealizing that my discount would end soon, I went ahead and bought another attempt at the Pentest+.

The default setup for Tailscale is only to allow root SSH access.  Now once I plug the Raspberry Pi into a network and it pulls a DHCP address, I will have a remote connection to it over my Tailnet.  As long as Tailscale would work on the network, I will have SSH access to it.</p><p>Then I add some tools.  I could just flash a Kali image onto the Raspberry Pi, but I don't want the operating system to be detected as Kali.  The first reason is because I will use this box as a troubleshooting tool and I don't want it be be identified as an intrusion.  The second reason is the same, but I don't want it to be fingerprinted if I am doing offensive work.</p><h2 id=\"tools\">Tools</h2><h3 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h3><ul><li>Go</li></ul><pre><code>sudo apt install golang-go\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc</code></pre><h3 id=\"network-scanning-discovery\">Network Scanning &amp; Discovery</h3><p><strong>nmap</strong> -

The second command sets the Tailscale service (tailscaled) to start at boot. The third command is to allow the current user SSH access. The default setup for Tailscale is only to allow root SSH access. Now once I plug the Raspberry Pi into a network and it pulls a DHCP address, I will have a remote connection to it over my Tailnet. As long as Tailscale would work on the network, I will have SSH access to it.\n\nThen I add some tools. I could just flash a Kali image onto the Raspberry Pi, but I don't want the operating system to be detected as Kali. The first reason is because I will use this box as a troubleshooting tool and I don't want it be be identified as an intrusion. The second reason is the same, but I don't want it to be fingerprinted if I am doing offensive work.\n\n\nTools\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n * Go\n\nsudo apt install golang-go\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\nNetwork Scanning & Discovery\n\nnmap -

PBS doesn't create full backups every time.<ul><li><strong>Incremental:</strong> After the <em>first</em> full backup, it only saves the blocks of data that have changed. This is much faster and uses far less network bandwidth.</li><li><strong>Deduplication:</strong> PBS is \"content-aware.\" It breaks backups into small, unique chunks. If you have 10 VMs running the same operating system, PBS stores the shared OS files <strong>only once</strong>. This results in enormous storage savings. A 100GB VM backed up daily for a week might only consume 110GB, not 700GB.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Strong Encryption (Client-Side)</strong> PBS encrypts your backup data <strong>on the Proxmox host</strong> <em>before</em> it's sent over the network to the backup server. This means your backup data is secure both in transit and at rest, even if the backup server itself isn't fully trusted. Backups to a standard NFS share are typically unencrypted.</li><li><strong>Data Integrity &amp; Verification</strong> PBS uses built-in checksums to ensure your data hasn't been corrupted (bit rot). You can schedule regular <strong>verification jobs</strong> to read back your backups and confirm they are intact and restorable. An NFS share provides no such guarantee; you won't know a backup file is bad until you try to restore it.</li><li><strong>Centralized Management</strong> PBS provides a clean web interface to manage all your backups, retention policies (e.g., \"keep 7 daily, 4 weekly, 3 monthly\"), verification schedules, and storage status from a single dashboard. Managing <code>vzdump</code> files on an NFS share is a manual process of deleting old files.</li><li><strong>File-Level Restore</strong> With PBS, you can browse the file system of a VM backup directly from the GUI and restore individual files or folders without having to restore the entire virtual machine. This is incredibly useful for quick recoveries.</li></ul><p>After discovering all of these features there was no way that I could run a Proxmox instance without Proxmox Backup Server.

It is a good thing Hak5 sent a little orange clip to place on the cable so that I could tell them apart.\n\nUpon opening the cable, I used the OMG Programmer and the Web Flasher to flash the firmware and make the cable usable. Afterwards I grabbed an extra Windows laptop and plugged the OMG Cable in. By default, the OMG cable acts as a hotspot creating its own network. After connecting to the OMG network, I opened a web browser and went to http://192.168.4.1. I was greeted with the OMG cable's web console.\n\nThere is a payload menu that allows you to create and save 50 different payloads and save one as a Bootscript that runs when the OMG cable comes online. The payloads are written in an enhanced version of DuckyScript and there is a repository with several pre-built payloads.\n\nGoing to the Settings, you have the option to change the OMG cables Wi-Fi settings. You can change the SSID, password, channel, and MAC address or you can change the OMG cable to connect to your existing Wi-Fi. There is also an option to connect to an OMG C2 server, but it is currently in beta. The OMG C2 allows you to connect to your OMG cable over the internet.\n\nThe USB settings allow you to configure hardware settings for the OMG cable. They also allow you to configure the Keylog and HIDX settings. If a keyboard is connected to a computer using the OMG cable, the OMG cable can act as a keylogger as well. It also allows you to use the OMG cable as a mouse jiggler. This helped me during testing by ensuring the host machine didn't go into sleep mode.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-11-09T21:32:12.000Z","updated_at":"2025-11-26T14:16:10.000Z","published_at":"2025-11-22T22:42:14.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1}],"posts_authors":[{"id":"6872e35cea3de800019e56c3","post_id":"6872e35cea3de800019e56c2","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"6872e429ea3de800019e5901","post_id":"6872e428ea3de800019e5900","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68925c808713bb00014172c1","post_id":"68925c808713bb00014172c0","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"6898d7d873824700012d5788","post_id":"6898d7d773824700012d5787","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"6898e21573824700012d57b5","post_id":"6898e21573824700012d57b4","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"689ceec139186500011b7618","post_id":"689ceec139186500011b7617","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"689e01f839186500011b7679","post_id":"689e01f839186500011b7678","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"689e09fb39186500011b7696","post_id":"689e09fb39186500011b7695","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68a0f62c70a4aa0001e359b5","post_id":"68a0f62c70a4aa0001e359b4","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68ac8070809fe900013124a8","post_id":"68ac806f809fe900013124a7","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68cf2e51828a7400010cd401","post_id":"68cf2e51828a7400010cd400","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68cf33e3828a7400010cd43d","post_id":"68cf33e3828a7400010cd43c","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68ddbaf95a7329000147b6f0","post_id":"68ddbaf85a7329000147b6ef","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68eac417f0a8ce000188cf42","post_id":"68eac416f0a8ce000188cf41","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68eb106ef0a8ce000188cf80","post_id":"68eb106ef0a8ce000188cf7f","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68efc9bc0e12d90001f5391e","post_id":"68efc9bb0e12d90001f5391d","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68efcde90e12d90001f53944","post_id":"68efcde90e12d90001f53943","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f008270e12d90001f53958","post_id":"68f008270e12d90001f53957","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f125a20e12d90001f53981","post_id":"68f125a20e12d90001f53980","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f135b10e12d90001f539aa","post_id":"68f135b10e12d90001f539a9","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f2ab7b0e12d90001f539d1","post_id":"68f2ab7b0e12d90001f539d0","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f3c13e0e12d90001f53a27","post_id":"68f3c13e0e12d90001f53a26","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f411230e12d90001f53acf","post_id":"68f411230e12d90001f53ace","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f42c800e12d90001f53aed","post_id":"68f42c800e12d90001f53aec","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f58cd80e12d90001f53afc","post_id":"68f58cd80e12d90001f53afb","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f6855a0e12d90001f53b39","post_id":"68f6855a0e12d90001f53b38","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f769180e12d90001f53b8a","post_id":"68f769180e12d90001f53b89","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"68f904520e12d90001f53bd7","post_id":"68f904520e12d90001f53bd6","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"69060964bc55cd00019dd4b4","post_id":"69060963bc55cd00019dd4b3","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0},{"id":"6911085cbc55cd00019dd4c1","post_id":"6911085cbc55cd00019dd4c0","author_id":"693db168b8f3890001a17266","sort_order":0}],"posts_meta":[{"id":"68eac8f8f0a8ce000188cf5c","post_id":"68eac416f0a8ce000188cf41","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null,"frontmatter":null,"feature_image_alt":null,"feature_image_caption":null,"email_only":0},{"id":"68f411490e12d90001f53ad4","post_id":"68f411230e12d90001f53ace","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null,"frontmatter":null,"feature_image_alt":null,"feature_image_caption":null,"email_only":0}],"posts_products":[{"id":"6872e43cea3de800019e5904","post_id":"6872e428ea3de800019e5900",
