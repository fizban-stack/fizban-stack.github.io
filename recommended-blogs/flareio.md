Flare.io has emerged as a leader in Identity Intelligence and Threat Exposure Management (TEM). Their research team provides unmatched visibility into the cybercrime world, monitoring millions of stealer logs and illicit channels to detect threats before they escalate into full-scale breaches.

## Why Follow This Blog

Flare’s research is essential for understanding the "human" side of cybercrime—how credentials are traded, how phishing kits are distributed, and how threat actors communicate on platforms like Telegram. Their analysis helps security teams move beyond traditional IOCs to focus on the actual exposures that precede an attack.

## Key Topics Covered

### Identity Intelligence
- **Stealer Log Monitoring**: Analyzing credentials harvested by malware families like RedLine, Raccoon, and Vidar.
- **Credential Leaks**: Monitoring combolists and database dumps for exposed corporate identities.
- **Session Hijacking**: Research into the intercept of live session cookies to bypass MFA.

### Dark Web & Illicit Communities
- **Telegram Monitoring**: Tracking fraud schemes and abuse across over 58,000 illicit channels.
- **Underground Marketplaces**: Analysis of the sale of access, phishing kits, and stolen data.
- **Ransomware Intelligence**: Mapping the real victims behind ransomware leak sites, such as the SafePay group.

### Predictive & Vulnerability Research
- **Exploitability Prediction**: Using CTI to predict which vulnerabilities threat actors are most likely to weaponize in their malware.
- **Threat Actor TTPs**: Deep dives into the tactics of emerging groups like PayTool.
- **Phishing Economies**: Research into "Phishing-as-a-Service" (PhaaS) and the automation of MFA bypass kits.

## Notable 2026 Research

- **The Phishing Kits Economy**: Comprehensive analysis of how modern "scama" bundles defeat MFA at scale.
- **SafePay Ransomware Mapping**: A detailed report on the SMB targets primarily impacted by this group.
- **Threat Flow Analysis**: Leveraging AI to contextualize and prioritize vast amounts of threat actor chatter from foreign sources.

## Who Should Follow

### Identity & Access Managers
Crucial for understanding how to protect enterprise accounts from takeover using valid credentials purchased on the dark web.

### Threat Intelligence Analysts
Ideal for professionals needing actionable intelligence on dark web trends, ransomware activity, and illicit marketplace chatter.

### Red Teamers & Bug Hunters
Valuable for understanding the current state of "unconventional" attack surfaces, such as leaked secrets on Docker Hub or misconfigured cloud services.
