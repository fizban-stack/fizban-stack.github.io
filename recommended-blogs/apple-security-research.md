The Apple Security Research blog provides an unprecedented look into the internals of one of the world's most hardened operating systems. 

## Research Methodology

### Memory Safety & Swift
- **Kernel Hardening**: Documenting the transition of XNU components to Swift for memory safety.
- **Pointer Authentication (PAC)**: Research into the hardware-level protections against memory corruption.

### Private Cloud Compute (PCC)
- **Verifiable Transparency**: How Apple ensures that AI processing in the cloud is as secure as on-device.
- **Stateless Infrastructure**: Technical deep dives into the specialized OS running Apple’s AI server nodes.

### Hardware-Software Synergy
- **Secure Enclave**: Analysis of the isolated subsystem for cryptographic operations.
- **Sandboxing Evolution**: Constant updates on App Sandbox and System Integrity Protection (SIP).
