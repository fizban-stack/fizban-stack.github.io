PortSwigger Research doesn't just find bugs; they define new classes of vulnerabilities. Their work fundamentally changes how the industry understands the relationship between web servers, proxies, and browsers.

## Notable Research Pillars

### Protocol Interference
- **HTTP Request Smuggling**: Evolution of desynchronization attacks.
- **H2C Smuggling**: Exploiting HTTP/2 cleartext upgrades.
- **Request Tunnelling**: Breaking through architectural boundaries.

### Cache & Architecture
- **Web Cache Poisoning**: Uncovering unkeyed inputs in global CDNs.
- **CPDoS**: Cache-based Denial of Service methodologies.

### Server-Side Exploitation
- **SSRF Reimagined**: Advanced techniques to hit internal metadata services.
- **Template Injection**: Discovering RCE in modern UI frameworks.

## 2026 Innovation
In 2026, PortSwigger has pivoted heavily into **Browser-Level Vulnerabilities** and **Advanced API Exploitation**, documenting how client-side state management can be weaponized against the backend.
