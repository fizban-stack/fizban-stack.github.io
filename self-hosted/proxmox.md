Proxmox VE is a complete open-source platform for enterprise virtualization that integrates KVM hypervisor and LXC containers.

## Key Features

- KVM and LXC support
- Web-based management interface
- High availability clustering
- Built-in backup solutions
- Software-defined storage
- Network virtualization

## Why I Use It

This wasn't the first virtualization platform that I tried, but it is the one that I will continue to use. It is open-source, feature-rich, and free for personal and business use. Proxmox is the foundation of my entire homelab infrastructure.
