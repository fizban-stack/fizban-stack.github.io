CyberChef is a web application for encryption, encoding, compression, and data analysis developed by GCHQ. It's like a Swiss Army knife for data transformations.

## Key Features

- 300+ operations
- Drag-and-drop recipe builder
- Base64, hex, binary encoding
- Encryption and hashing
- Data format conversion
- Network analysis tools

## Why I Use It

CyberChef is essential for CTF challenges and security work. The recipe system makes complex data transformations simple, and hosting it locally ensures sensitive data stays private.
