Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for building, testing, and deploying software.

## Key Features

- Continuous integration and delivery
- Extensible plugin ecosystem
- Distributed builds with controller-agent architecture
- Pipeline as code with Jenkinsfiles
- Integration with Git, Forgejo, and other VCS

## Why I Use It

Jenkins automates my site deployments by monitoring my Forgejo repository for changes and automatically building and deploying updates. It eliminates manual deployment steps and ensures consistency.
