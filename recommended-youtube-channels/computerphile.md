Computerphile may not be a dedicated "hacking" channel, but it is essential for understanding the theoretical foundations of cybersecurity. Hosted by academics from the University of Nottingham, it explains the math and logic that secure (or fail to secure) our systems.

## Channel Focus

### Cryptography
- **Encryption**: Mathematical explanations of RSA, AES, and Elliptic Curves.
- **Hashing**: Understanding collisions, rainbows tables, and salting.

### Low-Level Logic
- **Memory Management**: How stacks, heaps, and pointers function at the hardware level.
- **Web Protocols**: How the internet actually moves data (TCP/IP, Handshakes).

## Why Follow This Channel
To build the deep theoretical knowledge that separates an engineer from a script runner.
