  </div><p>Hello, My name is James Wells.  I am an aspiring cybersecurity practitioner, father of three, and home lab enthusiast.  I have dedicated a large amount of time and money over the last five years to these projects and plan on using this space to present them.  I want to do this not only to help my career, but also for my own learning documentation.  I started a blog using Ghost a little while ago.  Links are available in the navigation bar and the footer.</p>

  <H2>Self-Hosted</H2>
  <p>I have recently added a Self-Hosted page that I have listed a few of my favorite self-hosted applications.  This is by no means a comprehensive list, but does include most of the core applications that I use daily. I plan on adding more to this list when I have more time to go through my Docker stack and build pages for the applications. I will say that if I had to choose just one of these services to keep, it would be Proxmox. I have tried using Virtual Box, VMware Workstation Pro, and Hyper V, but I liked the idea of having a remote always on box that was not my daily driver. I used TrueNAS for a while and experimented with XCP-ng, but I also ended up coming back to Proxmox. It has a WebUI that can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. You can only create and edit VMs or you can dive into Software-Defined Networking, VM Templates, and more complex topics. I have been using it for years and have used it in many different configurations, from high-availability clusters to a couple of standalone nodes.</p>

  <H2>Free Cybersecurity Training</H2>
  <p>I added another page to my site in which I have listed some of the free places that you can receive cybersecurity or even just IT training. This is also not a comprehensive list and the services are not ordered in any specific way. I just wanted to put together a list for people that are just starting to learn about cybersecurity and are having a hard time finding the best resources out of the massive amount available online today.</p>

  <H2>Recommended Podcasts</H2>
  <p>This might be the last page that I add to my site. It is a list of some of my favorite podcasts related to IT or cybersecurity. They are also not ordered in any specific way. Most of them are technical and I have to admit that when I was just learning, I had no idea what they were talking about. As I continued to grow and learn, I would spend time learning a topic like cross-site request forgery and then I would remember hearing about it in the Critical Thinking Podcast, go back and listen to that episode, and it would help to build my understanding of more complex topics that textbooks don't often teach. Critical Thinking Podcast is one of my favorite because they full-time bug bounty hunters, some of the best in the world, and they don't just give you a quick breakdown of a topic, they dive into the technical details. Listening to these podcasts also helped me to become familiar with a lot of the industry language and terminology and find topics that I was interested in learning more about. I spend a lot of time driving around for my job and I like to listen to podcasts instead of music because I feel like my time is to valuable to not spend it learning and growing. This isn't to say that I don't like or listen to music. I have a massive music collection from almost every genre, but I prefer to listen to music when I am learning with my hands and eyes, while doing chores around the house, or when I am feeling some type of way.</p>
