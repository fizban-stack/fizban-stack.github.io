  </div><p>Hello, My name is James Wells.  I am an aspiring cyber security practitioner, father of three, and home lab enthusiast.  I have dedicated a large amount of time and money over the last five years to these projects and plan on using this space to present them.  I want to do this not only to help my career, but also for my own documentation.  I started a blog using Ghost a little while ago.  It is available at this <a href="https://www.blog.wellslabs.org">link</a> for anyone interested in reading it.</p>

  <H2>Week 2</H2>
  <p>This week I learned how to make variables is SCSS and to define different styles using mixins that can be reused with minimal code.  I also learned how to override the default CSS using SCSS variables and CSS Preprocessing.  I learned that CSS can be split up between smaller files called partials.  I can see several use cases for this including have a base CSS and then creating a seperate CSS for different style pages, such as blog pages or about pages.  This would allow me to quickly and easily change the style of specific pages without digging through one large style sheet.  I could also use a partial to define the variables.  This would ensure that the main CSS is not crowded with the variable definitions.  I also learned about branching repositories and then merging the branches back into the main branch.  This allows the package maintainer to view all changes that a contributer requests before they allow it to be merged back into the main branch.</p>
