Hello, My name is James Wells. I am an aspiring cybersecurity practitioner, father of three, and home lab enthusiast.
    I have dedicated a large amount of time and money over the last five years to these projects and plan on using this
    space to present them. I want to do this not only to help my career, but also for my own learning documentation.
    I started a blog using Ghost a little while ago. Links are available in the navigation bar and the footer.
</p> <article data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> <h2 data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Self-Hosted</h2> <p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
I have recently added a Self-Hosted page that I have listed a few of my favorite self-hosted applications. This is
      by no means a comprehensive list, but does include most of the core applications that I use daily. I plan on adding
      more to this list when I have more time to go through my Docker stack and build pages for the applications. I will
      say that if I had to choose just one of these services to keep, it would be Proxmox. I have tried using Virtual Box,
      VMware Workstation Pro, and Hyper V, but I liked the idea of having a remote always on box that was not my daily driver.
      I used TrueNAS for a while and experimented with XCP-ng, but I also ended up coming back to Proxmox. It has a WebUI
      that can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. You can only create and edit VMs or you can dive into
      Software-Defined Networking, VM Templates, and more complex topics. I have been using it for years and have used it
      in many different configurations, from high-availability clusters to a couple of standalone nodes.
</p> </article> <article data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> <h2 data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Free Cybersecurity Training</h2> <p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
I added another page to my site in which I have listed some of the free places that you can receive cybersecurity
      or even just IT training. This is also not a comprehensive list and the services are not ordered in any specific way.
      I just wanted to put together a list for people that are just starting to learn about cybersecurity and are having a
      hard time finding the best resources out of the massive amount available online today.
</p> </article> <article data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> <h2 data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Recommended Podcasts</h2> <p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
This might be the last page that I add to my site. It is a list of some of my favorite podcasts related to IT or
      cybersecurity. They are also not ordered in any specific way. Most of them are technical and I have to admit that
      when I was just learning, I had no idea what they were talking about. As I continued to grow and learn, I would
      spend time learning a topic like cross-site request forgery and then I would remember hearing about it in the Critical
      Thinking Podcast, go back and listen to that episode, and it would help to build my understanding of more complex topics
      that textbooks don't often teach. Critical Thinking Podcast is one of my favorite because they full-time bug bounty hunters,
      some of the best in the world, and they don't just give you a quick breakdown of a topic, they dive into the technical details.
      Listening to these podcasts also helped me to become familiar with a lot of the industry language and terminology and find
      topics that I was interested in learning more about. I spend a lot of time driving around for my job and I like to listen
      to podcasts instead of music because I feel like my time is to valuable to not spend it learning and growing. This isn't
      to say that I don't like or listen to music. I have a massive music collection from almost every genre, but I prefer to
      listen to music when I am learning with my hands and eyes, while doing chores around the house, or when I am feeling some
      type of way.
